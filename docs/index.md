# Introduction

## Background

Recently we went through the process of selling our house here in the Netherlands and the first quote we had was an automated one from the [funda](https://funda.nl) app. 

I found this very interesting and I decided to build a proxy for that service. Being surrounded by engineers in my family and having studied civil engineering myself, I knew what factors would be the most influential which would allow me to focus on the technical implementation. 

## Objective

The goals for this project are to:

1. build a simple, yet complete, end-to-end pipeline for predicting house prices,
2. build a web app where users can input various characteristics and receive a quick quote (via an api call), and
3. deploy the web app using Docker and AWS.
